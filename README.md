    <h1>☁️ Cloudflare Web Application Expressions</h1>
</div>

Using these expressions, you can effectively block all unnecessary requests to your server.
Additionally, it is recommended to disable the `Bot Fight Mode` feature located in the `Security` tab.
This function aims to detect and block automated traffic from bots. However, it often blocks safe bots as well, which is not our intention.

## ⚠️ Warning
It is important to note that these expressions should not be used if you are utilizing WordPress or any similar content management system (CMS).
However, they are **highly recommended for Node.js applications** based on frameworks like Express, for example.
