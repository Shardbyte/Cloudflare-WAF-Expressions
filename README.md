    <h1>‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudflare Web Application Firewall Expressions</h1>
</div>

With these expressions (for WAF), you can effectively block all unnecessary requests to your server, enhancing its security and performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Additionally, it is recommended to **disable** the `Bot Fight Mode` function found in the `Security` tab.
> The purpose of this feature is to detect and stop automated traffic from bots. However, it often blocks safe and legitimate bots, which is not our intention.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
Please note that these expressions should not be used if you are utilizing [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) or any similar content management system ([CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)), as they may interfere with its normal functioning.
They are **highly recommended for Node.js applications** built on frameworks like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) (for example).

> [!TIP]  
> Remember to come back here from time to time. To make sure they remain up to date and effective against the most recent threats, these lists are updated often.

## üõ°Ô∏è What can this list block?
This list has been carefully crafted to improve the security of your origin server by blocking a wide range of pointless and potentially malicious requests. The following is a summary of what it can block:

1. **Sensitive files and directories:**
   - Prevents access to critical files and directories, such as `.git`, `.env`, `.htaccess`, which often contain sensitive information that should never be publicly accessible. It also blocks access to other commonly used configuration files and keys, such as SSH keys and similar items.

2. **Common attack vectors:**
   - Blocks URLs containing patterns often used in attacks, helping to thwart attempts to exploit known application vulnerabilities.

3. **Backup files:**
   - Protects against requests for access to backup files that could contain sensitive data. This includes common backup file extensions and patterns.

4. **Outdated browsers:**
   - Identifies and blocks outdated browser versions that are often used by bots for automated attacks or unnecessary web crawling. Additionally, it can block DDoS attacks from botnets, which commonly use outdated user agents.

5. **Unwanted bots:**
   - Blocks various unwanted, unnecessary web crawlers and known malicious bots by analyzing specific user-agent strings. This helps reduce unwanted bot traffic and alleviate server resource strain.

6. **Specific IP addresses and ASNs:**
   - Blocks traffic from known malicious IP addresses and ASNs, helping to prevent attacks from sources flagged as malicious. The list also includes some IP addresses associated with botnets.

By using this collection, you may significantly increase the security of your website and reduce the quantity of unwanted traffic on your server.


## ‚ùå What will this list never block?
1. Known and safe search engine indexing bots such as `Google`, `Bing`, `DuckDuckGo`, `Yandex`, `Yahoo!`, and others.
2. Outgoing requests from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) applications using libraries like `node-fetch`, `axios`, `superagent`, `request`, and similar.
3. Outgoing requests from tools like `curl`, `wget`, `Postman`, `httpie`, `Insomnia`, and similar.
4. Legitimate traffic from commonly used APIs and services that are essential for the proper functioning of your application.
5. Webhooks and callbacks from trusted third-party services, ensuring seamless integration and communication.
6. Requests for standard web files such as `robots.txt`, `ads.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `humans.txt`, and similar, which are essential for proper web indexing and advertising management.
